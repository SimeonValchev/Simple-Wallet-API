# Wallet API

A simple wallet API built using Spring Boot. This API allows users to create wallets, add funds, withdraw funds, and check balances via RESTful endpoints.

## Features

- Create wallets
- View wallet balances
- Deposit money into wallets
- Withdraw money from wallets
- Command-line interface for user interaction

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.4.1**
- **Maven**

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java 8** (or higher)
- **Maven**

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SimeonValchev/Simple-Wallet-API.git

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash

The API will now be running on http://localhost:8080 and the command-line interface will open shortly after.
